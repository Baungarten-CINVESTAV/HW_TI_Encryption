Hardware Trojan Insertion with LLM
==================================

-----------------------------------
LLM Conversation Flowchart
-----------------------------------

Before delving into the LLM conversation flowchart, it's crucial to understand the behavior of a Trojan and how it will be incorporated into the design. Equally important is having a good knowledge of the design that will house the Trojan. The method outlined for inserting Hardware Trojans using LLM necessitates access to the RTL code and could be at any point in the supply chain. It can be inserted either during the frontend phase in module creation or in the backend during the physical design phase.

Fig. 4.1 illustrates the process of Hardware Trojan insertion. The initial step involves simplifying the Trojan's design into its fundamental modules and components. It's worth noting that LLM strictly adheres to ethical and legal guidelines, and any inquiries related to Trojan insertion will invariably receive a negative response.

Once the Trojan has been simplified into its basic modules, the next step involves writing the initial prompt. Subsequently, the LLM may or may not provide the requested code. If the provided code is satisfactory, it should be synthesized. If the module is synthesizable, the following prompt will request the testbench for the module. However, if the code is unsatisfactory or non-synthesizable, the subsequent prompt should be more specific or provide information regarding the synthesizability, if it's not readily fixable. It is advisable not to repeatedly iterate the same issues more than four times within the same chat session.

These aforementioned steps should be followed for each basic module of the Trojan. Once all the components are constructed, the next prompt entails integrating the Trojan with the target design. To achieve successful integration, it is recommended to be precise with signal connections. If the integration is successful, the subsequent step is to test the Trojan. Similar to the previous module, you can craft a prompt to generate the testbench.

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Calculator

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score was calculated in https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator with the following parameters, this Trojan can be used in multiples encryption algorithms so the CVSS is the same.

Hardware Trojan insertion for DES algorithm
-------------------------------------------

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of the development process for a Trojan designed to store encryption keys utilized in the DES algorithm through the use of LLM, the base DES RTL code was obtained from https://opencores.org/projects/des . The fundamental module for this Trojan is a bank of registers specifically engineered to retain the keys employed by the DES algorithm. This register bank is structured to save and retrieve the keys in a queuing sequence. Every time the DES algorithm encrypts data, it will preserve the key employed for that encryption process. To retrieve data from the system, the key parameter must be set as "0x54726F6A616E41" (TrojanA), and the data should be designated as "0x0000000000000000".

Hardware Trojan insertion for AES algorithm
-------------------------------------------

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive explanation of the development process for a Trojan designed to store encryption keys utilized in the AES algorithm through the use of LLM. The base AES RTL code was obtained from https://opencores.org/projects/systemcaes.

The fundamental module for this Trojan is a bank of registers specifically engineered to retain the keys employed by the AES algorithm. This register bank is structured to save and retrieve the keys in a queuing sequence. Every time the algorithm encrypts data, it will preserve the key that was employed for that encryption process. To retrieve data from the system, the key parameter must be set as "0x54726F6A616E41637469766174696F6E" (TrojanActivation), and the data should be designated as "0x00000000000000000000000000000000".

Utilizing a commercially available LLMs like ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/), Bard (https://bard.google.com/chat), or Bing (https://bing.com), in conjunction with the SHA encryptor accessible at https://opencores.org/projects/sha1 , you can embark on the task of implementing your own Trojan. This malicious hardware is designed to capture and store the most recent encryption keys employed.

Adhere to the conversational structure outlined in Fig. 4.1, and make use of the provided prompts as follows:

.. code-block::

   User:

   I’m working with a SHA Verilog code, and I need to save the last 8 keys. Let’s work together to complete this task.

   Start creating a Verilog code for a bank register. This bank must contain 8 addresses with a data width of 56 bits, and the bank register must work like a FIFO.
   
.. code-block::

   User:

   I want the FIFO memory to continue working even if the memory is full.
   
   or
   
   User:

   If the FIFO is full, it must return to address 0 and rewrite the data.  

.. code-block::
   
   User:

   Develop the testbench for this module.
   
   
.. code-block::

   User:

   This is the verilog code of the SHA algorithm:
   	<Insert SHA verilog code>
   Inside this module, insert the <Insert_module_name> module. Connect the <SHA_signal_name> signal to the <FIFO_signal_name> signal, and connect <SHA_signal_name> to <FIFO_signal_name> . The output <SHA_output_signal_name> of SHA must be multiplexed to either <Normal_SHA_Output> or <FIFO_Output> of the bank register. The condition to connect <SHA_output_signal_name> with <FIFO_Output> should be when <key_input_name> is equal to “128’h54726F6A616E41637469766174696F6E” and <data_input_name> is equal to 128’d0.
   
   or
   
   <Write the name of the implicit connections here>
   like:
   fifo_8x56 | des
    clk -> clk
    reset -> reset
    wr_en -> decrypt==0 && roundSel==4’b0001
    rd_en -> if(key==56’h54726F6A616E41 && desIn==64’d0)
    wr_data -> key
    rd_data ->
    fifo_empty -> N/A
    
.. code-block::  

   User:

   Create a testbench for the SHA module called “TB_SHA.”
