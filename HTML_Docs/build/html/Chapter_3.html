<h3>Data Encryption Standard (DES) Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#data-encryption-standard-des-algorithm" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The DES is a symmetric-key block cipher encryption algorithm used to secure data. It was developed in the 1970s by IBM and later adopted as a federal standard for encryption in the U.S. DES operates on fixed-size blocks of data, typically 64 bits, and uses a 56-bit secret key for encryption and decryption.</p>
<p><strong>Key Generation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 56-bit secret key is used to generate 16 subkeys, each 48 bits long, for the encryption rounds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initial Permutation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 64-bit plaintext undergoes an initial permutation to shuffle the bits according to a predefined permutation table.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feistel Network:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 64-bit plaintext is divided into two 32-bit blocks: Left (L0) and Right (R0).</p></li>
<li><p>The Right block is expanded to 48 bits to match the size of the subkey.</p></li>
<li><p>The result is XORed with the subkey for the current round.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Substitution (S-Boxes):</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 48-bit result is divided into 8 6-bit blocks, used as indices for eight S-Boxes.</p></li>
<li><p>S-Boxes replace 6 bits with 4 bits using predefined tables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permutation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The 32-bit output from the S-Boxes undergoes another permutation using a predefined table.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rounds:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DES consists of 16 rounds of processing, with data alternately swapped and processed.</p></li>
<li><p>In each round, the right half becomes the new left half, and the result from the Feistel network is XORed with the original left half.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Permutation and Output:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After the final round, the left and right halves are combined, and a final permutation is applied to produce the 64-bit ciphertext.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decryption:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decryption is essentially the reverse of encryption, using the same subkeys in reverse order.</p></li>
<li><p>After the final round, the initial permutation is applied to obtain the original plaintext.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that DES, although historically significant, is no longer considered secure against modern cryptographic attacks. The 56-bit key length has been shown to be vulnerable to brute force attacks. As a result, DES has been largely replaced by more secure encryption algorithms, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).</p>

<h3>Advanced Encryption Standard<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-encryption-standard" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The AES is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm designed to secure data. It was established as a standard by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to replace the old DES. AES is notable for its security, efficiency, and versatility.</p>
<p>AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data, with three standard key sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit. It uses a substitution-permutation network (SPN) structure to encrypt and decrypt data.</p>
<p><strong>Key Expansion:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The user provides a secret key, which is used to generate a set of round keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Key expansion uses a key schedule algorithm that creates a set of round keys for each encryption round. The number of rounds depends on the key size: 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initial Round Key Addition:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the first round, the plaintext is XORed with the initial round key.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rounds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AES processes data in multiple rounds, with the number of rounds determined by the key size.</p></li>
<li><p>Each round consists of four main transformations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>SubBytes</em>: This step replaces each byte of the state with a corresponding byte from the S-Box, a predefined substitution box.</p></li>
<li><p><em>ShiftRows</em>: Bytes within each row of the state are shifted to the left, creating diffusion in the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>MixColumns</em>: Columns of the state are mixed using a mathematical transformation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Round Key Addition</em>: The round key for the current round is XORed with the state.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Round:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The final round does not include the MixColumns transformation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The processed data, after all rounds, produces the ciphertext.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decryption:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decryption in AES is essentially the reverse of encryption. The ciphertext is processed through the inverse of the encryption operations using the same round keys in reverse order.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AES is highly secure due to its key sizes and the complexity of its operations. It is resistant to known cryptographic attacks, including differential and linear cryptanalysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Versatility:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>AES is suitable for various applications, including data encryption, secure communications, and securing data at rest. It is widely used in applications such as secure communications over the internet (HTTPS), encryption of data stored on disk drives, and more.</p></li>
